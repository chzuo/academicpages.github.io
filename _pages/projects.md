-Check-Worthy Claims Recogintion System
-======
-In recent years, the speed at which information disseminates has received an alarming boost from the pervasive usage of social media. To the detriment of political and social stability, this has also made it easier to quickly spread false claims. Due to the sheer volume of information, manual fact-checking seems infeasible, and as a result, computational approaches have been recently explored for automated fact-checking. In spite of the recent advancements in this direction, the critical step of recognizing and prioritizing statements worth fact-checking has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines simple heuristics with supervised machine learning to identify claims made in political debates and speeches, and provide a mechanism to rank them in terms of their "check-worthiness". The viability of our method is demonstrated by evaluations on the English language dataset as part of the Check-worthiness task of the CLEF-2018 Fact Checking Lab.
